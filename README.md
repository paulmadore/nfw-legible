# Version 0.5
## Fuck That Shit

HTML and CSS were not meant to be hard for people to copy, modify, etc.

This CSS file, in its original form, is not just an abomination, but an 
attack on the very principals the web of hyptertext documents was founded on.

In setting up my pastebin installation, I've decided to eliminate all the 
useless code and slim it down to what the script actually uses. But here is the 
whole file so that you can mess with it. 

In Version 0.75 I aim to fully document everything that's going on in this 
monstrosity. I believe these kinds of things are done intentionally and that is
why I am undoing it. I may later add other complicated HTML/CSS files. 

Remember: HTML and CSS are not programming. Nor, really, is Javascript. At least,
that's how I feel. I self-taught this stuff when I was barely a teenager, maybe
before actually. So I don't believe they're the kind of skills that should be
closed off from kids who are at that age today and may have an interest in
building their own little websites.

Here's to clean and legible code.
